Crud Operation in DotNet

1) The project a product page where you can add a product but, you should have created the category of that product prior to creating the product.
you would need the category id to create the product and include it in the appropriate category. In the product page you have crud fucntions such as create, delete, edit and a details function which shows
all the related information in a table manner.

2) Then, we have a category page in which we have similar crud functions which can be used to modify the data.

3) At last we have the home page where you could see all the details and you could navigate from this page to another for making changes in the product or category page.
Pagination is only included in this page it would view 1-10 products on a single page the another 10 on the next page.
